To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. Here they have provided a partial data set.

## How risky is the borrower?
Given the borrowerâ€™s risk, should we lend him/her?
In the modern era, the data science teams in the banks build predictive models using machine learning to predict how likely a client is going to default the loan when they only have a handful of information. Loan Prediction is a very common real-life problem that each retail bank faces at least once in its lifetime. If done correctly, it can save a lot of man hours at the end of a retail bank.
